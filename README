# @OhChristmasTwee

You can find a write up of how this all works here:

(http://www.austinrobertson.com/projects)

You will have to customize the following settings in ohchristmastwee.py

## TW_USERNAME TW _PASSWORD ##

Twitter username used by the tweetstream library to access the Streaming API. Any valid username and password will work. Nothing will be tweeted on this user name.

## OAuth

You will need to input the OAuth settings if you want to enable the Twitter bot. Please refer to [this page](http://talkfast.org/2010/05/31/twitter-from-the-command-line-in-python-using-oauth) for finding your OAuth variables. 

* CONSUMER_KEY
* CONSUMER_SECRET
* ACCESS_KEY
* ACCESS_SECRET 
* TWEET_URL

## TWEETS
 
This is a list of tweets the Twitter bot will @mention anyone who changes the colors. The %s is replaced by the username, color(s), and tweet url, respectively.
